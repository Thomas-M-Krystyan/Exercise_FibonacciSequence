# Fibonacci_Sequence
Implementation of four the most popular Fibonacci sequence algorithms:

1. iteration with temporary variable, FOR loop, summarize and swap technique,
2. iteration with temporary variable, WHILE loop, swap technique and incrementation,
3. recursion with IF condition and parameters replacement,
4. double recursion with SWITCH-CASE condition and Fibonacci formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

Adding implementation of ExecutableStopwatch and method to count the actual runtime.<br>
Implementation of ThreadPool for paralleling calculations for double recursion algorithm.<br>
Implementation of small console's helper's methods and flow logic.
