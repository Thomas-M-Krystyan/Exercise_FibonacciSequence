# Fibonacci_Sequence
Implementation of the most popular Fibonacci sequence algorithms:

1. iteration with temporary variable, FOR loop, incrementation, summarize and swap technique,
2. iteration with temporary variable, WHILE loop, decrementation, and swap technique,
3. recursion with IF condition and parameters substitution,
4. double recursion with SWITCH-CASE condition and Fibonacci formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),
5. upgraded and optimalized version of previous formula-algorithm which is using memorization strategy.

Adding implementation of ExecutableStopwatch and method to count the actual runtime.<br>
Implementation of ThreadPool for paralleling calculations (used with delegate Func<>).<br>
Implementation of small console's helper's methods and flow logic in application's Main.<br>

**Idea behind MEMORIZING in recursive Fibonacci:**
